# Changelog

This project addresses the Jev-only compaction failure modes described in [Hermes PR #116246](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/116246). The work below concerns calibrated scoring, protected evidence, text condensation, bounded requests, batching, and operational visibility.

## [Unreleased]

Jev-LCM Compaction Plugin for Hermes: Jev ranks stale evidence before LCM condenses conversation history.

### Added

- Rolling threshold calibration and a minimum retention floor, addressing the fixed-threshold failure.
- Assistant anchor extraction and verbatim evidence retention, addressing identifier loss during summarization.
- Raw SQLite evidence storage and retrieval, independent of active-prompt retention.
- Tiered state shaping and explicit unscored candidates for oversized batches.
- Batched scoring with forced lifecycle flushes and serialized concurrent requests.
- TypeSafe and OpenRouter provider resolution, retries, fallback, cooldown diagnostics, and secret-safe status output.
- Compaction counters and a warning after repeated low token savings.

### Changed

- Protected evidence and active-context assembly are being reworked against the original product contract.
- Host integration tests now supplement scoring and storage helper tests.

### Architecture

LCM remains responsible for evidence storage and context assembly. Jev supplies ranking hints; it never rewrites raw messages. Pinned source regions are excluded from scoring. Scoring failure falls back to the host condensation path.

### Release blockers

The production recall-at-budget comparison, fresh-profile installation qualification, provider parity review, final documentation review, and publication remain open. No stable 1.0.0 release is asserted here. The requested September 19 release heading must not imply a release occurred before acceptance.

Tamara Tran contributed the upstream state-shaping and two-question scoring design. TheEpTic supplied the Hermes integration precedent. Stephen Schoettler authored Hermes-LCM's storage, summary DAG, and retrieval implementation. Bojan Sandhaus supplied Jev Decisions product and documentation conventions. TypeSafe supplies Jev; OpenRouter supplies an alternative provider surface. Ehrlich and Blackman authored the LCM research cited in the original brief.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-19 (prepared, unpublished)

Jev-LCM Compaction Plugin for Hermes: Jev ranks stale evidence before Lossless Context Management condenses conversation history.

Fixes the Jev-only compaction failure modes identified in [NousResearch/hermes-agent#116246](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/116246).

### Added

- Jev scoring pass before LCM condensation, so ranking happens on evidence that is still verbatim.
- Assistant-text anchor extraction and protected retention, covering the recall gap the PR identified.
- Calibrated keep thresholds derived from observed score distributions, replacing the fixed `0.5` default.
- Tiered state shrink ladder with a hard token cap and explicit `jev_unscored` marking.
- Batched scoring across turns with forced flushes at lifecycle boundaries.
- LCM hint consumption so ranking decisions reach active-context assembly with raw evidence pointers.
- Recall-tool compatibility for `lcm_grep`, `lcm_expand`, and node inspection.
- Provider fallback contract and observability counters.
- Recall-at-budget evaluation harness in `evaluation/`.
- Dual-provider authentication across TypeSafe and OpenRouter with automatic fallback.

### Architecture

- LCM remains the source of truth and the primary text compressor.
- Jev is a ranking layer only; it never rewrites raw evidence.
- Pinned regions are excluded from scoring.
- Provider selection is configuration driven and never prints key values.

### Finding map

| PR #116246 finding | Shipped correction |
|---|---|
| Fixed `keep_threshold: 0.5` dropped every scored candidate | Rolling threshold calibration with a `0.15` low-sample fallback, a `0.40` cap, and a `0.10` minimum keep rate |
| Tool-call ranking missed assistant text | Regex anchor extraction and a protected verbatim index carried into assembled context |
| A Jev-only text floor grew across long runs | LCM remains the primary compressor and storage owner; Jev ranks |
| A 25K state ceiling forced blind decisions | T0 to T4 shrink ladder, hard request cap, and explicit `jev_unscored` candidates |
| Per-turn scoring disturbed the prompt cache | Three-turn batch window with pressure and lifecycle flushes |
| Metrics hid the cost of compaction | `lcm_recall_at_budget`, `lcm_freed_per_compaction`, `jev_unscored_count`, live threshold, provider counters, and a repeated low-freed warning |

### Status

Release content is complete but unpublished. The production recall-at-budget comparison remains unproven because the upstream transcript and evaluation policy were not supplied. The GitHub remote, repository topic, and draft release use the stored Git credential. Registry publication still requires an authenticated npm session, which this machine does not have. See [docs/compliance.md](docs/compliance.md) and [docs/verification.md](docs/verification.md).
